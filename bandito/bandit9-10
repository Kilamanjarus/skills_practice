Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

Commands I learned:
strings (strings prints out strings on printable characters in specified file) -a means all, and -d is printable data
Things I tried:
grep -f data.txt == (= invalid character?)
strings -a  -d data.txt
