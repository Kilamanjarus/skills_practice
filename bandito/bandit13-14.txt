Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

Helpful Reading Material
SSH/OpenSSH/Keys


Commands I learned:
ssh -i file_name logs into ssh server using a private key(file_name)
Things I tried:
cat sshkey.private
ssh -i bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 (forgot filename after -i, wrong port as I am supposed to use localhost {bandit14@localhost})
ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private (entered correctly)
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
