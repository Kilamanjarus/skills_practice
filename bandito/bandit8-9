Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

Helpful Reading Material
Piping and Redirection

Commands I learned:
cat (showed all lines, not one)
uniq (doesn't work with lines not adjacent)
sort (sorts lines so they are adjaces)
sort data.txt | uniq -u (sorted data.txt and the printed out all unique lines)

Things I tried:
cat data.txt (doesn't work, hundreds of lines of code)
cat data.txt | uniq (adding | allows for multiple commands)
  adding -u to uniq makes it return unique strings only
