Rot13 on Wikipedia

Commands I learned:
tr (meaning translate) 'A-Za-z' 'Z-Az-A' (First specifies what numbesr are being translated, second describes the translation)

Things I tried:
cat data.txt (jumped characters, hinted to be a rot13)
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' (reads the data with cat, but translates it with tr before printing to terminal)
